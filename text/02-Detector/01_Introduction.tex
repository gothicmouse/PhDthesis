\label{chp:det:intro}
Exploring the $\tev$ energy scale requires particle accelerators and the corresponding experiments to be designed and built for this purpose. The first part of this chapter describes the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with a particular emphasis on the evolution of the running parameters over the past years of operation. The second part of this chapter is focused on the ATLAS detector, one of the four large experiments studying the high-energy collisions produced by the LHC. An overview of its subdetector components and their performance is also provided.\\
