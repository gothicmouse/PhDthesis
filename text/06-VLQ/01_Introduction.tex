This chapter presents a broad search for new phenomena involving top quarks and Higgs bosons, probing several physics processes predicted by BSM models. The search targets a variety of signals:

\bi
\ib pair production of a vector-like top quark ($T$) (see section \ref{sec:theo:vlq}) with a significant branching ratio to a top quark and either a SM Higgs boson or a $Z$ boson,
\ib four-top-quark production within the SM and in several BSM scenarios (see section \ref{sec:theo:fourtops}), and
\ib heavy Higgs bosons (neutral and charged) produced in association with, and decaying into, third-generation quarks (see section \ref{sec:theo:hdm}).

This search uses the data and simulated samples described in chapter \ref{chp:data}. In this chapter the event selection, analysis strategy, event categorisation, and the discriminating variable are discussed, and the details of the profile likelihood fit are explained. Results and interpretations of this search are presented at the end of the chapter along with a comparison with other existing searches. Finally, prospects for future improvements are discussed.
