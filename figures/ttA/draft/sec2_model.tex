While CP-odd scalars are present in many extensions of the SM, for simplicity and generality of our results, we use a simplified model approach \cite{Alves:2011wf} to parametrise the contribution of this particle in the process $p p \to t \bar{t} A \to t \bar{t} b \bar{b}$. More precisely, we add couplings of the CP-odd scalar with the bottom and top quarks to the full SM Lagrangian 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SM}} + \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CP-odd}},
\label{eq:lagrangian}
\end{eqnarray}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CP-odd}} = i \frac{g_{t} y_t}{\sqrt{2}}~\bar{t} \gamma_5 t A + i \frac{g_{b} y_b}{\sqrt{2}}~\bar{b} \gamma_5 b A,
\end{eqnarray}
and $g_i$ ($i=t,b$) parametrises the deviation from the SM Yukawa coupling  $y_i = m_i/v$.

Recently, a similar approach was proposed to recast monojet searches at the LHC in terms of scalar mediators between the SM and a secluded sector \cite{Buckley:2014fba,Harris:2014hga,Haisch:2015ioa,Khoze:2015sra}. In a similar way, we will focus on the minimal set of free parameters relevant to the process considered. Throughout this paper we will assume $A$ to be a narrow resonance with $2 m_b \leq m_A < 2m_t$. Hence, in our approach the CP-odd scalar decays exclusively into bottom quarks with ${\cal B}(A\to b\bar{b})=1$ and its width $\Gamma_A$ is completely determined by the value of $g_b$. 
%We choose to identify $g_b \equiv y_b = \sqrt{2}~m_i / v$. Note, since $A$ decays promptly after production the choice of $c_b$ has only an impact on $\Gamma_A$, the width of $A$. 
For a narrow resonance, the kinematic distributions are expected to remain largely independent of the value of $\Gamma_A$.
