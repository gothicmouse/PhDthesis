\subsection{Analysis strategy and event selection}
\label{subsec:analysis}
This search is focused on the $\ttbar A \to W^+b W^- \bar{b}b\bar{b}$ process, with one of the $W$ bosons
decaying leptonically and the other $W$ boson decaying hadronically. Only electrons or muons originating 
from $W$ boson or $\tau$-lepton decays are considered. The resulting final state signature is thus characterised
by one electron or muon, and high jet and $b$-jet multiplicity that can be exploited to suppress the background,
dominated by $\ttbar$+jets production. Therefore, the following preselection requirements are made:
one electron or muon, $\geq$5 AKT4 jets and $\geq$3 AKT2 $b$-tagged jets, in the following simply referred
to as $\geq$5 jets and $\geq$3 $b$-tags. In order to optimise the sensitivity of the search, the selected events 
are categorised into two separate channels depending on the number of $b$-tags (3 and $\geq$4).
The channel with $\geq$5 jets and $\geq 4$ $b$-tags has the largest signal-to-background ratio and 
therefore drives the sensitivity of the search. It is dominated by $\ttbar$+HF background. The channel with 3 $b$-tags 
has significantly lower signal-to-background ratio and the background is enriched in $\ttbar$+light-jets.
The simultaneous analysis of both channels is particularly useful to calibrate {\sl in-situ} the $\ttbar$+jets background prediction 
(including its heavy-flavour content) and constrain the related systematic uncertainties, as it will be discussed in
Sec.~\ref{sec:stat_analysis}. This is a common strategy used in many experimental searches in the 
ATLAS and CMS collaborations~\cite{Aad:2015gra,Khachatryan:2015ila,Aad:2015kqa}, 
which we mimic here in order to obtain more realistic projected sensitivities.

An extra handle is provided by the significant boost of the $A$ boson in a fraction of signal 
events, which results in the two $b$-jets from the $A \to b\bar{b}$ decay emerging with small angular separation between them.
This is particularly relevant for low $m_A$ values, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DRbb_ttA}.
As a result, the $A$ boson decay products can be reconstructed into a single fat jet, whose mass distribution would show a 
resonant structure peaked at the correct $m_A$ value. This feature is also very powerful to discriminate against the background.
Therefore, a further requirement is made to have at least one C/A BDRS-filtered jet with radius parameter $R^{\rm CA}$ and minimum $\pt$
depending on the $m_A$ hypothesis being tested. In order to correctly reconstruct a significant fraction of the signal while rejecting as 
much background as possible,  CA6 jets are used for $m_A \leq 40$ GeV, while CA8 jets are used for higher $m_A$ values (up to 100 GeV). 
The minimum $\pt$ requirements on the C/A jets are 60, 100, 120, 150, 200 and 250 GeV for
$m_A=20, 30, 40, 60, 80$ and 100 GeV, respectively. 
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DRbb_ttA}, for high values of $m_A$ only a small fraction of signal events would have the $A$ decay products contained
within the CA8 jet. The small signal acceptance comes with the benefit of improved background rejection and
the ability to reconstruct the $A$ boson mass, desirable in such simple analysis. However, it is expected that a dedicated multivariate 
analysis focused on the sample rejected by this analysis, similar in spirit to the ATLAS and CMS searches for the SM Higgs boson in 
$t\bar{t} h$, $h \to b\bar{b}$~\cite{Aad:2015gra,Khachatryan:2015ila}, could also achieve significant signal sensitivity at high $m_A$. 
Evaluating this possibility is beyond the scope of this study.
The number of $b$-tags inside the C/A jet is determined by
matching the $b$-tagged AKT2 jets within a cone of radius $\Delta R =0.75 R^{\rm C/A}$. 
Finally, a requirement is made is that the C/A jets have $\geq$ 2 $b$-tags inside. In case of more than one selected C/A jet,
the leading $\pt$ one is chosen. 

Table~\ref{tab:yields} presents the expected yields for signal and the SM backgrounds 
per fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity as a function of the selection cuts applied in each
of the analysis channels under consideration: ($\geq$5j, 3b) and ($\geq$5j, $\geq$4b).
In the case of the ($\geq$5j, 3b) channel, the dominant background after final selection
is $\ttbar$+light-jets, where typically the two $b$-quarks from the  top quark decays, as well as
the $c$-quark from the $W \to c\bar{s}$ decay, are $b$-tagged.
In contrast, in the ($\geq$5 j, $\geq$4 b) channel half of the background is $\ttbar$+$\geq$$1b$,
with $\ttbar$+$b\bar{b}$ being its leading contribution. The rest of the background is approximately 
equally split between $\ttbar$+$\geq$$1c$ and $\ttbar$+light-jets.
In this table the expected contribution from $\ttbar A$ signal is obtained under the assumptions of $g_t=2$ and ${\cal B}(A\to b\bar{b})=1$.
Both analysis channels have approximately the same amount of signal, while the background
is about a factor of four higher in the ($\geq$5j, 3b) channel than in the  ($\geq$5j, $\geq$4b) channel.
Together with the different composition of the background, the very different signal-to-background
ratio between both channels is the primary motivation for analysing them separately.

The final discriminating variable is the invariant mass of the selected C/A jet, referred to as 
``leading BDRS jet mass". Figures~\ref{fig:mA_1} and~\ref{fig:mA_2} show the expected distribution of the BDRS jet mass
for signal and background in each of the analysis channels, for the different $m_A$ values considered. The distributions
correspond to $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and are normalised to an integrated luminosity of 30 fb$^{-1}$.
For the assumed values of $g_t=2$ and ${\cal B}(A\to b\bar{b})=1$, the signal is clearly visible
on top of the background.

\subsection{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:systematics}

Several sources of systematic uncertainty are considered that can affect the normalisation of signal 
and background and/or the shape of the BDRS jet mass distribution. 
Individual sources of systematic uncertainty are considered uncorrelated.  Correlations of a given 
systematic uncertainty are maintained across processes and analysis channels. 
The choices of what uncertainties to consider and their magnitude are inspired by recent 
$\ttbar$+$h_{\rm SM}$, $h_{\rm SM}\to b\bar{b}$ searches at the LHC~\cite{Aad:2015gra}.

A 15\% normalisation uncertainty is assigned to $\ttbar$+light-jets corresponding to the modelling of the jet multiplicity 
spectrum. A 30\% normalisation uncertainty is assigned to each of the $\ttbar$+HF components ($\ttbar$+$b$, 
$\ttbar$+$b\bar{b}$, $\ttbar$+$B$, $\ttbar$+$c$, $\ttbar$+$c\bar{c}$, $\ttbar$+$C$), and taken to be uncorrelated among 
them. These uncertainties are expected to be conservative given the recent progress in NLO predictions for $\ttbar$ with
up to two jets merged with a parton shower~\cite{Hoeche:2014qda}, as well as NLO predictions for $\ttbar$+$\geq 1b$ production 
in the 4F scheme matched to a parton shower~\cite{Cascioli:2013era}. Cross section uncertainties for $\ttbar$+$W$, $\ttbar$+$Z$ and
$\ttbar$+$h_{\rm SM}$ are taken to be 30\% for each process. Uncertainties associated to jet energy and mass calibration are taken
to be 5\% per jet, fully correlated between energy and mass and across all jets in the event. Finally, uncertainties on the
$b$-, $c$- and light-jet tagging efficiencies are taken to be 3\%, 6\% and 15\% respectively. These uncertainties are taken 
as uncorrelated between $b$-jets, $c$-jets, and light-jets. 
As shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:mA_1} and~\ref{fig:mA_2}, the resulting total background normalisation uncertainty is about 20\%, 
although the different uncertainty components have different shape in the final distribution.

\subsection{Statistical analysis}
\label{sec:stat_analysis}

The BDRS jet mass distribution in the two analysis channels 
under consideration (see Figs.~\ref{fig:mA_1} and~\ref{fig:mA_2}) are tested for the presence of
a signal. To obtain the most realistic possible sensitivity projection, a sophisticated statistical analysis   
is performed, following very closely the strategy adopted in the experimental analyses at the LHC.

For each $m_A$ hypothesis, 95\% CL upper limits on the $\ttbar A$ production cross section times branching ratio, 
$\sigma(\ttbar A) \times {\cal B}(A \to b\bar{b})$, are obtained with the CL$_{\rm{s}}$ method~\cite{Junk:1999kv,Read:2002hq} 
using a profile likelihood ratio as test statistic implemented in the {\sc RooFit} package~\cite{Verkerke:2003ir,RooFitManual}. 
The likelihood function ${\cal L}(\mu,\theta)$ depends on 
the signal-strength parameter $\mu$,  a multiplicative factor to the theoretical signal production cross section,
and $\theta$, a set of nuisance parameters that encode the effect of systematic uncertainties in the analysis.
The likelihood function is constructed as a product of Poisson probability terms over all bins of the distributions analysed, 
and of Gaussian or log-normal probability terms, each corresponding to a nuisance parameter. 
For a given assumed value of $\mu$, the profile likelihood ratio $q_\mu$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
q_\mu = -2\ln({\cal L}(\mu,\hat{\hat{\theta}}_\mu)/{\cal L}(\hat{\mu},\hat{\theta})), 
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\hat{\theta}}_\mu$ are the values of the nuisance parameters that maximise the likelihood 
function for a given value of $\mu$, and $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ are the values of the parameters 
that maximise the likelihood function (with the constraint $0\leq \hat{\mu} \leq \mu$).
The maximisation of the likelihood function over the nuisance parameters allows variations of the expectations 
for signal and background in order to improve the agreement with (pseudo-)data, yielding a
background prediction with reduced overall uncertainty and thus resulting in an improved sensitivity.
For a given $m_A$ hypothesis, values of the production cross section (parameterised by $\mu$) yielding 
CL$_{\rm{s}}$$<$0.05, where CL$_{\rm{s}}$ is computed using the asymptotic 
approximation~\cite{Cowan:2010js}, are excluded at $\geq$95\% CL.
